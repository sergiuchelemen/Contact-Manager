# contact-manager

•	I developed a Contact Manager application utilizing Node.js and Express for the backend, and JavaScript, HTML, EJS and CSS for the frontend. The application is powered by MongoDB as the database and provides an authorization and authentication system via JWT.

•	The RESTful API ensures data exchange, providing the application with CRUD operations through simple and consistent HTTP requests.

•	Unit tests made with Jest and supertest.
